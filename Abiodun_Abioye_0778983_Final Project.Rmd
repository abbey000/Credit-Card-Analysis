## Section 1

### Introduction

The dataset contains the cross-section data on the credit history for a sample of applicants for a type of credit card.
The dataset contains 1,319 observations on 12 variables.
The dataset was downloaded from Datasets in R Packages portal.

The analysis aims to investigate the variables that influence credit card approvals. I will also be using models to predict monthly credit card expenditure using age and yearly income.  

Source: [Click Here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html)

### Hypothesis:
1) Monthly credit card expenditure increases with yearly income.
2) Self employed applicants are more risky and hence should have lower card approval rates 

The variables, datatype and a brief description are listed below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 1: *card* \| *character* \| *Was the application for a credit card accepted?*\
> 2: *reports* \| *double* \| *Number of major derogatory reports.*\
> 3: *age* \| *double* \| *Age in years plus twelfths of a year.*\
> 4: *income* \| *double* \| *Yearly income (in USD 10,000).*\
> 5: *share* \| *double* \| *Ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income.*\
> 6: *expenditure* \| *double* \| *Average monthly credit card expenditure.*\
> 7: *owner* \| *character* \| *Does the individual own their home?*\
> 8: *selfemp* \| *character* \| *Is the individual self-employed?*\
> 9: *dependents* \| *double* \| *Number of dependents.*\
> 10: *months* \| *double* \| *Months living at current address.*\
> 11: *majorcards* \| *double* \| *Number of major credit cards held.*\
> 12: *active* \| *double* \| *Number of active credit accounts.*

### Analysis Questions

1) Is there a relationship between age and yearly income?\
2) Is there a relationship between yearly income and monthly credit card expenditure?\
3) Does age influence an applicants length of stay at current address?\
4) Do derogatory reports affect credit card approval?\
5) Does owning a home improve your chances of approval?\
6) Whats the impact of self employment on approval?\


## Section 2

### Data Analysis Plan
**Approach**\
1) Exploratory Data Analysis\
2) Analysis of correlation among selected variables\
3) Analysis of Linear Regression Models

**Outcome Variables:** *expenditure*\
**Predictor Variables:** *income*, *dependents*, *age*\

Statistical Methods: Median, IQR, Linear Regression.\
Median and IQR have been chosen because the data is skewed. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis\
##### No Missing Values

```{r}
# Search for missing data
sapply(CreditCard, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Convert variables to correct datatypes
CreditCard_df <- convert(CreditCard, int(age, dependents, months, active))
```
##### Summary Statistics
```{r}
# Display Summary Statistics
describe(CreditCard_df)
```

### Univariate Analysis (One numeric variable)

Age distribution.
The Histogram shows the modality (Unimodal) and skewness (right skewed) of the variable.
It also reveals the presence of outlier values.\
The Median age is `r median(CreditCard_df$age)`. The IQR of age is `r IQR(CreditCard_df$age)`.

```{r}

ggplot(CreditCard_df, aes(age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = 'red', fill = 'white') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(age)), colour = 'green') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(age)), colour = 'blue') + labs(title = 'Age Distribution: Mean is Green, Median is Blue', x = 'Age', y = 'Count')
```

```{r}
new_CreditCard <- CreditCard_df %>%
  filter(age >= 18 )
```

New Age distribution(after removing outlier ages under 18).
The Histogram shows the modality (Unimodal) and skewness (right skewed) of the variable.Â 
The Median age is `r median(new_CreditCard$age)`.
The IQR of age is `r IQR(new_CreditCard$age)`.

```{r}
ggplot(new_CreditCard, aes(age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = 'red', fill = 'white') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(age)), colour = 'green') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(age)), colour = 'blue') + labs(title = 'Age Distribution: Mean is Green, Median is Blue', x = 'Age', y = 'Count')
```

##### Income distribution: The Histogram shows the modality (Unimodal) and skewness (right skewed) of the variable.

The Median income is `r median(new_CreditCard$income)`.
The IQR of income is `r IQR(new_CreditCard$income)`.

```{r}
ggplot(new_CreditCard, aes(income)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = 'white', fill = 'red') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(income)), colour = 'green') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(income)), colour = 'blue') + labs(title = 'Income Distribution: Mean is Green, Median is Blue', x = 'Income (in USD10,000)', y = 'Count')
```

##### Distribution of Average Monthly Credit Card Expenditure. Plot is Unimdal, right skewed

The Median expenditure is `r median(CreditCard_df$expenditure)`.
The IQR of expenditure is `r IQR(CreditCard_df$expenditure)`.

```{r}
ggplot(new_CreditCard, aes(expenditure)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color = 'white', fill = 'skyblue') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(expenditure)), colour = 'green') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(expenditure)), colour = 'blue') + labs(title = 'Distribution of Credit Card Expenditure', subtitle = "Mean is Green, Median is Blue", x = 'Average Monthly Credit Card Expenditure', y = 'Count')
```

##### The density plot shows the relationship between home ownership and age. Majority of respondents between 30-40 own their own homes

```{r}
ggplot(new_CreditCard, aes(x = age, y = owner, fill = owner, alpha = 0.2)) +geom_density_ridges() +theme_ridges() + theme(legend.position = "none")+labs(x="Age",y="Home Ownership",title = "Distribution Home Ownership across ages")
```

##### The density plot shows the relationship betweem Self employment status and age. Similar Distribution between respondents who are self employed and those who are not

```{r}
ggplot(new_CreditCard, aes(x = age, y = selfemp, fill = selfemp, alpha = 0.2)) +geom_density_ridges() +theme_ridges() + theme(legend.position = "none")+labs(x="Age",y="Self Employment Status",title = "Distribution Employment across ages")
```

### Multivariate Analysis (One numeric variable and two categorical variables)

The plot shows a lower median and IQR for Self Employed workers.
This means self employed workers have lower average monthly credit card expenditure than regular workers\

```{r}
ggplot(new_CreditCard, aes(x=expenditure, y=selfemp, colour = owner)) + geom_boxplot() +labs(title = "Expenditure of Self employed and Employed Workers", x = "Average Monthly Credit Card Expenditure", y = "Self Employment Status")
```

##### Self employed home owners earn the most followed by employed home owners. In summary, home owners earn more.

```{r}
ggplot(new_CreditCard, aes(x=income, y=selfemp, colour = owner)) + geom_boxplot() +labs(title = "Income of Self employed and Employed Workers", x = "Yearly Income (in USD10,000)", y = "Self Employment Status")
```
